## About This Project

Laravel quickstart is a scaffolding project designed to provide a foundation for a working web application.

I believe that the process of learning 'Web Development' should be an enjoyable and creative experience for all, and using Laravel is a great way to get stated.

Laravel quickstart takes the pain out of getting started on your development journey by setting up a basic web project for you to play, hack and hopefully create something constructive.

The following is a short list of features that have already been incorporated:

- 2 fully working components along with their required models.
- An example of using foreign key relationships.
- Sensible validation with separation for Create and Update for both components.
- Example for initial data population.
- Example of using events and listeners.
- Sending an email notification.
- Working unit testing for most actions.
